# Javascript

* JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
* JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
* JavaScript is easy to learn.
* This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.


*JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator.*

## Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

### Control flow:
**Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. **
